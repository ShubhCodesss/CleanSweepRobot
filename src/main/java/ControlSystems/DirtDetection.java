/**
 * Research Notes: Software-Based Dirt Detection Simulation
 *
 * - Techniques for simulating dirt in a virtual environment:
 *   - Represent dirt as data points scattered across a virtual floor map.
 *   - Detect dirt using virtual sensors that "scan" the map, marking areas as dirty.
 *   - Implement basic algorithms to trigger virtual cleaning when a dirty area is detected.
 *
 * - Triggering Cleaning:
 *   - Simulate triggers when a virtual sensor detects "dirt" (a specific data value).
 *
 * - Considerations:
 *   - Accuracy in detecting virtual dirt without false positives in clean zones.
