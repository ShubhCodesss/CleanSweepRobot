/**
 * Research Notes: Software-Based Power Management Simulation
 *
 * - Simulating Battery Life:
 *   - Define energy consumption for each action (e.g., moving, cleaning) in a virtual environment.
 *   - Battery levels decrease as the robot performs these actions.
 *
 * - Return-to-Charging Simulation:
 *   - When battery is low, the robot will be directed to return to a simulated charging station (a location in the virtual environment).
 *
 * - Considerations:
 *   - Optimizing movement to reduce simulated energy consumption.
 *   - Handling power-saving modes in a virtual world.
