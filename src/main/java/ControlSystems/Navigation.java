 * Research Notes: Navigation Simulation
 *
 * - Algorithms for virtual navigation:
 *   - A* Algorithm: A pathfinding algorithm that simulates movement through a virtual environment.
 *   - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: Used for shortest pathfinding in a graph-like floor map.
 *   - Potential Field Method: An algorithm where the robot is repelled from obstacles and attracted toward the goal.
 *
 * - Virtual sensors:
 *   - Simulate LiDAR using raycasting techniques to detect virtual obstacles.
 *   - Simulate Infrared by projecting a straight-line sensor detection.
 *
 * - Key challenges in software:
 *   - Efficient collision detection algorithms in a virtual grid.
 *   - Dynamic updates to the environment during movement simulation.
