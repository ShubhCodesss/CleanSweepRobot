# CleanSweepRobot
Clean Sweep Sensor Simulator - Sprint 0 
Project Overview
This project simulates the movement and cleaning behavior of the Clean Sweep robotic vacuum. The simulation takes place on a grid-based floor plan, where each cell in the grid represents a portion of the environment, defined by properties such as surface type, obstacle, charging station, and dirt level. The initial focus in Sprint 0 is on establishing the basic structure and movement functionality.

Sprint 0 Objectives
In Sprint 0, the key goal is to:

Define the floor plan using a 2D array, where each cell has its own attributes.
Implement basic movement logic for the Clean Sweep, allowing it to move across the grid.
Check for obstacles during movement to prevent invalid movements.
Provide basic sensor feedback for the Clean Sweep's current position, such as surface type, dirt level, and charging station status.
